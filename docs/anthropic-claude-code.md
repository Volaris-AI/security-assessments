## 2. Vendor Overview

### 2.1 Product Capabilities & Feature Availability

- **Local Code Editing & Fixes**
  - File read/write operations with explicit user permission per action
  - Patch generation, lint/autofix, and guided code reviews
- **Testing & CI Automation**
  - Unit and integration test creation/fixing via `/test` commands
- **Repository Search & Navigation**
  - `git grep`, history analysis, merge conflict resolution
- **Web Search & Documentation**
  - Secure web browsing with explicit approval, isolated sandbox
- **Plugin SDK**
  - Build custom tools via Node.js SDK, granular scope and IAM-based auth

### 2.2 Product Details

- **Deployment Model:** Local CLI and SDK installed via npm; model inference over HTTPS to Anthropic API (or Bedrock/Vertex with reduced telemetry)
- **Geographical Locations:** Data passes through Anthropic-hosted inference endpoints in multiple AWS regions; China access via partner endpoints
- **Key Stakeholders:** Engineering and Security teams at Anthropic; Developer and DevOps users building on Claude Code

## 3. Intellectual Property Protection

- **Code Ownership:** All user code remains local; Claude Code does not retain or share source files unless explicitly sent via `/bug` or feedback
- **Model IP:** Anthropic retains model weights and API intellectual property; no local caching of weights

## 4. Data Security & Encryption

### 4.1 Encryption in Transit

- All CLIâ€“API communications secured with TLS 1.2+; HSTS enforced
- Web search and MCP calls via HTTPS with certificate validation

### 4.2 Encryption at Rest

- No user data stored on Anthropic servers by default (zero retention orgs)
- Feedback transcripts encrypted at rest (AES-256) for 30 days only

## 5. Data Lifecycle & Privacy

- **Default Retention:** Server retains chat transcripts 30 days (configurable via zero retention flag)
- **Local Sessions:** CLI caches sessions locally for 30 days, user-configurable
- **Feedback Transcripts:** Stored 30 days for debugging; not used to train generative models
- **Opt-Out Controls:** `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING`, `DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`

## 6. AI & Model Training Practices

- **Default Policy:** No training on prompts or code sent to Claude Code; models are frozen foundation models
- **Partner Program Opt-In:** Customers may join Development Partner Program to share data for training
- **Synthetic Data:** Models updated with synthetic, anonymized traces via internal processes

---

## 7. Security Certifications & Compliance

- **SOC 2 Type II** (API services)
- **ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018** certificates available
- **GDPR, CCPA Compliance** via Trust Center policies

Evidence URLs:

---

## 8. Risk Management & Governance

- **Permission-Based Architecture:** Default read-only; write/execute operations require explicit approval
- **Built-In Protections:** Prompt injection mitigations, command blocklists (`curl`, `wget`), context-aware analysis
- **Telemetry & Error Monitoring:** Statsig (metrics), Sentry (errors), optional VPN/Proxy support
- **Secure Defaults:** Nonessential traffic off for Bedrock/Vertex; uniform behavior across providers

---

## 9. Incident Response & Disclosure

- **Reporting Channels:** `/bug` command; HackerOne VDP program
- **Response:** Encrypted transcript collection on `/bug`, automated triage, SOC-led incident handling
- **Transparency:** Security advisories via Trust Center

## 10. Questions & Responses

1. **Is user code ever stored or used to train models?**
   - No. By default, Claude Code does not train models on user prompts or code; only anonymized feedback is used if opted in.
2. **How is local vs. cloud data differentiated?**
   - All code editing happens locally; inference payloads sent over TLS, no permanent caching on server.
3. **What telemetry is collected and how is it protected?**
   - Operational metrics (no code paths) via Statsig; errors via Sentry; both encrypted in transit and at rest.
4. **How are command permissions enforced?**
   - CLI prompts for each file/write/cmd; protected by built-in prompt system with user authorization.
5. **What compliance standards apply?**
   - SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 certifications and GDPR/CCPA controls documented in Trust Center.
